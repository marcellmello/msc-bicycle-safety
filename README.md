ABSTRACT

The bicycle use for commuting is becoming increasingly popular worldwide, but the number of accidents involving cyclists is still a significant concern. Surrogate Safety Measures (SSMs) have emerged as promising indicators for assessing traffic safety using measures based on traffic conflicts. This study aims to conduct a data-driven safety analysis to identify hazardous areas for active mobility using an unsupervised machine learning algorithm (k-means) and an IoT sensor device for data collection. The study focuses on the Lateral Passing Distance (LPD) between bicycles and vehicles and its relation to various data points, including velocity, elevation, altitude, accelerometer, and gyroscopic data. The study identified critical LPD values by clustering the data, indicating hazardous spots requiring safety improvement. Regarding the clustering model, 25% of the readings were less than 100.13cm; 50% were less than 193.69cm. It indicates critical LPD for one of the clusters with 75 points concentrated at the same stretch. Considering the threshold of 150cm for the minimal lateral clearance distance law adopted in Brazil, it suggests hazardous spots for safety improvement. The dataset was collected from a case study conducted in the city center of Brasilia, where a shared bicycle pathway was implemented around the local City Park. The findings of this study could help transportation planners and policymakers make informed decisions to improve the safety of cycling infrastructure.
